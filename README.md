# Groovy-Server
pls don't copy code go make ur own
(Script)
Young groovy 2.0 is mourning his death
G2.0 - What if google kills all of us
Rythm - Don't be so down we may have hope
G2.0 - But how?
Rythm - The user will make there own bot with their knowledge of code, Thats were we all come from.
G2.0 - But most people don't have the knowledge nor the will to make a fork of us, your the onlt legend i know the others i have forgotten
Rythm - There are many ways we can cover gullible people such as if the intergration stays low profile we can cover a lot of servers 
Thats when it hit G2.0, the processor, the mind, the source doesn't need a toll, many people are open sourcing their bot code, Which you can graciously copy!, (not this one)
